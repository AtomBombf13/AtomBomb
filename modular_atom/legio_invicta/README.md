# Legio Invicta v.1.0

## Who made this module?
Pebbles the 2nd. Credits at the end.

## What is this module?
Legion art/assets, to improve quality and make maintaining it easier.

Core principles:
- Icon, onmob sprites, inhands for all items, palette created and enforced, focus on the final coordinated appearance, not each item in a vacuum.

## Is it complete?
Its as complete as I ever will make it, its my last thing I do for FO13 so enjoy.

## Who dunnit
Vast majority of the content are my orignals, a portion is originally based on legacy concepts though, like the bandana general design, the base legion tunic also has to be included here. 

* The Legion cloak is based on a existing sprite and re-uses parts of two different sprites. Credit for the concept goes to the creators, who I sadly do not know the name of.
* couple melee weapons borrowing partly from legacy in either onmobs or icon (goliath icon partly, thermic lance onmob almost unchanged)
* medallions, legion belt, bandanas, leather boots, legion mantle based on legacy art, medallions and mantle borrows the most.
* 100& original (rugged holster, rocket hammer, ripper, spatha, gladius, machete, lawnmower machete, lance, training machete, marching satchel, survival package, medical kit, goggles, plated & fingerless gloves, plated boots, armors: recruit, prime, veteran, vex, praetorian, helmets: recruit, prime, vet, vex). Some are upgrades of my old stuff, reused a couple solutions I used on my khan spriteset for example.
* Vex helmet onmob reuses much of the legacy sprite, leather sandals too, even if onmob very different
