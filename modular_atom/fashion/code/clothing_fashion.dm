// I collected some clothing sets I made here.
// If a hat has HIDEEARS, you wont be able to take off or add a item to the ear slot while wearing it.
// If a hat has HIDEEYES, same goes for eyeslot items
// Also the head/helmet subtype has inherited component protecting against flashbang (identical to bowmans), and immunity to eye attacks.
// The above things makes the widespread use of head/helmet problematic, since hats and variour helmets covering neither ears nor eyes for no reason blocks removing/adding ear and eye stuff, and makes flashbangs inconsistent, and sand in eye attacks useless in 90% of the scenarios.
// feel free to comment out stuff you transfer to base code but don't erase stuff in here, that would break the whole modular thing forever.
